# HTML Files

For more advanced sites that could benefit from things like loops and conditionals etc will need to use [PHP files](PHP-Files.md), but if your site is even simplier, then you just need HTML.

StaticPHP takes away the headache of using HTML files with a static site. You still need PHP for running StaticPHP, but you don't need to write any PHP code for your site during development.

Combining StaticPHP's [MetaData](MetaData.md) feature with HTML files gives you the power to develop your site using only HTML files without any PHP, and best of all, no headache that comes with HTML files.
