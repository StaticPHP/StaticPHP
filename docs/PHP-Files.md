# PHP Files

Create a PHP file as you normally would, and write PHP code as you normally would. StaticPHP will take the processed output and turn it into a static HTML file for you.

This will let you do things such as use loops to loop through content and also have the same content across all pages, without the headache of doing all the final output coding yourself.

**NEW:** Don't need PHP for your site, just want rid of the headache of managing a static site? Use [HTML files](HTML-Files.md)!
